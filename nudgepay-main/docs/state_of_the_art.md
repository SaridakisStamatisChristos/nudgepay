# NudgePay Production Readiness Review

This document highlights the remaining gaps keeping NudgePay from a "state of the art" production posture, even after the latest
round of improvements.

## 1. Infrastructure & Configuration
- **Secrets governance**: Configuration supports strict validation and AWS Secrets Manager lookups, yet there is no automated
  rotation, expiry enforcement, or multi-provider abstraction. Advanced secrets workflows (staged rotation, just-in-time access)
  remain manual. 【F:nudgepay/app/config.py†L22-L244】【F:nudgepay/app/secret_manager.py†L10-L86】
- **Runtime policy management**: Settings are still loaded at process start with no dynamic reload or feature-flag service, so
  environment toggles and tenant overrides require deployments. Blue/green config promotion is absent.
- **Infrastructure as code depth**: Terraform scaffolding exists but only shells out module outputs without provisioning network,
  database, or observability resources. Additional modules for VPCs, managed databases, Redis, and alerting should be codified. 【F:nudgepay/ops/terraform/main.tf†L1-L27】【F:nudgepay/ops/terraform/modules/nudgepay/main.tf†L1-L13】

## 2. Security & Authentication
- **Admin access model**: Roles/permissions are stored with each admin, yet application endpoints simply gate on a login session,
  leaving high-risk actions (password rotation, reminder sends) without policy enforcement, approval workflows, or break-glass
  controls. 【F:nudgepay/app/admins.py†L13-L130】【F:nudgepay/app/main.py†L260-L340】
- **Enterprise identity**: There is no SSO, SCIM, or hardware-token support. MFA is optional per admin and not enforced across
  roles, and there is no device management or session revocation API. 【F:nudgepay/app/auth.py†L16-L163】
- **Secrets & credentials**: Admin passwords rely on bcrypt hashes managed via environment values; there is no password complexity
  enforcement, credential rotation policy, or detection of leaked passwords.

## 3. Application Architecture
- **Tight coupling**: HTTP handlers intermingle request parsing, business logic, and persistence, making domain testing and
  dependency injection difficult. A service layer or command bus pattern would improve modularity. 【F:nudgepay/app/main.py†L180-L420】
- **Background processing**: Reminder workflows enqueue tasks to Redis/RQ when available, but there is no dedicated worker
  deployment topology, workload prioritisation, or observability around queue depth. Failures rely on manual review of the
  `outboundjob` table. 【F:nudgepay/app/tasks.py†L1-L158】
- **Data lifecycle**: Only a single migration is present and there are no guardrails for destructive changes, archiving, or data
  retention policies. 【F:nudgepay/alembic/versions/20240910_01_initial.py†L1-L57】

## 4. Resilience & Observability
- **Incident automation**: Health checks and metrics exist, but there are no auto-remediations (DLQ replay, chaos drill toggles),
  runbook automation, or paging integrations codified in CI/CD. Operators must trigger `disaster_recovery.sh` manually. 【F:nudgepay/scripts/disaster_recovery.sh†L1-L86】
- **Tracing & analytics**: Prometheus metrics cover requests, reminders, and payments, yet there is no distributed tracing,
  log sanitisation pipeline, or SLO/error budget reporting. Alert thresholds in the observability guide remain manual suggestions. 【F:nudgepay/app/metrics.py†L1-L200】【F:nudgepay/observability/README.md†L1-L34】
- **External integrations**: Retries guard SMTP/Stripe calls, but there are no circuit breakers, regional failover strategies, or
  contract tests to detect upstream schema changes early. 【F:nudgepay/app/emailer.py†L1-L63】【F:nudgepay/app/payments.py†L1-L60】

## 5. Deployment & Operations
- **Continuous delivery**: GitHub Actions stops at plan/scan stages; there is no automated promotion, canary analysis, or staged
  rollout with health-based aborts. Terraform apply requires manual invocation. 【F:.github/workflows/ci.yml†L93-L189】
- **Runtime footprint**: Static assets are still served directly by the FastAPI app rather than a CDN with caching and WAF
  policies. A state-of-the-art deployment would front the service with a zero-trust ingress and managed certificate rotation. 【F:nudgepay/app/main.py†L72-L100】
- **Compliance and auditability**: While audit logs record admin actions, there is no documented PCI/GDPR alignment, retention
  schedule, or automated evidence collection to satisfy regulatory reviews. 【F:nudgepay/app/audit.py†L1-L120】

Addressing these advanced capabilities—particularly automated identity governance, modular infrastructure, and closed-loop
operational automation—would push NudgePay toward a state-of-the-art readiness bar.
